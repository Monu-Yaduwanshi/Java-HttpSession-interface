# Java-HttpSession-interface
This repository contains a Java Servlet-based web application demonstrating user authentication through login and logout functionality. The application validates user credentials and manages user sessions effectively.

Features
User Authentication: Allows users to log in with hardcoded credentials and checks for validity.
Session Management: Utilizes HttpSession to maintain user sessions after successful login and invalidate them on logout.
Dynamic Response: Displays personalized messages and redirects users to their profile page upon successful login.
Error Handling: Provides user-friendly messages for invalid login attempts and requires login for accessing the profile page.
Technologies Used
Java Servlet: Implements HttpServlet to handle HTTP requests and responses.
MySQL Database: (Potential for future enhancements; currently uses hardcoded credentials).
Apache Tomcat: Acts as the web server for deploying and running the servlet application.
Eclipse IDE: Used for development and project management.
