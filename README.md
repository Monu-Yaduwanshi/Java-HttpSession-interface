# Java Login Form Using HTTP Session in Servlets 🚪🔑

Welcome to the **Java Login Form Using HTTP Session** project! This web application demonstrates user login functionality using **Java Servlets**, **MySQL**, and **Apache Tomcat**, along with managing user sessions through the HttpSession API. It provides an intuitive interface for users to log in, view their profiles, and log out securely.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔑 User Authentication**: Secure login using hardcoded credentials (can be extended to database-driven authentication).
- **💼 Session Management**: Efficient user session handling through HttpSession for personalized experiences.
- **📄 Profile Page**: A profile page displays the logged-in user's details.
- **⚠️ Error Handling**: Graceful handling of incorrect login credentials with helpful messages.
- **🖥️ Clean User Interface**: A clean and responsive HTML/CSS layout for the login, profile, and logout pages.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Java Servlet API (Jakarta)**: Servlets to handle HTTP requests, sessions, and redirections.
- **Apache Tomcat Server**: Provides the environment to deploy and run the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Clean and modern frontend for user interaction.
- **MySQL Database** *(optional)*: Easily extendable to connect with a MySQL database for real-world applications.
